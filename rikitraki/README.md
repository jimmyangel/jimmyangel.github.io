This github site currently hosts the following three projects:

* [RikiTraki.com](http://rikitraki.com) - A hiking log application. Currently deployed as 'alpha' version. I will be improving both content and functionality over time. Full "source" available [here](https://github.com/jimmyangel/rikitraki).

* [Rikitraki.com TestDB](http://rikitraki.com/TestDB/) - Instance of RikiTraki.com for testing purposes, pointing to web services and database back-end hosted in OpenShift. User registration and ability to upload user tracks will be posted here for testing before promoting to RikiTraki.com.

* [A hike in Abel Tasman NP, NZ](http://rikitraki.com/Maps/MapGeo/index.html)- I developed this application for my final assignment deliverable ("Storytelling with maps") for the [Maps and the Geospatial Revolution](https://class.coursera.org/maps-003) MOOC course by Dr. Anthony C. Robinson, that I took between March and April of 2015. This was the starting point for [RikiTraki.com]().
