In some places, the trail completely hangs off very high and completely vertical mountain cliffs (in some cases balcony-type) with no fences or hand rails at all. At 1.4 miles from Nocelle, the trail forks into an upper and lower segments. The upper trail is less exposed, a bit more wooded/shaded, and it passes through a couple of farming terraces with great views. In some places you can see the lower trail. The lower trail is more exposed to the cliffs and offers stunning views of the sea and the little towns of Positano, Nocelle, Praiano and Arienzo. In Bomerano, and the point of return in this track, there is a restaurant with no name, with excellent local food and friendly service. \nThe trail starts at the <a href=\"http://www.villadeglidei.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Villa Degli Dei</a> -- turn left where there is a small shrine and a water fountain. To reach it, you need to walk down from the Nocelle parking through the town footpath and stairs (about 0.1 miles/200m). ",

It is a very large flat area sitting between Mount Jefferson and Park Ridge in the north side of the mountain. Jefferson Park contains several beautiful lakes, numerous ponds, tarns and flower-filled meadows. This approach to Jefferson Park comes from the west, starting at the Whitewater trailhead. It gently climbs up to Sentinel Hills through an old growth forest with gigantic firs. Upon reaching Sentinel Hills,  there are magnificent views of the Whitewater Creek and Russell Creek valley to the south and Mount Jefferson to the East. The trail joins the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) at approximately 4 miles from the trailhead and then ascends to the southeast end of Jefferson Park, near Scout Lake. The hike continues to Russell Lake and then returns wandering around the meadows and around Scout Lake. In early summer, the wildflowers are an extraordinarily beautiful sight, but the mosquitoes can be brutal, so be sure to pack a good insect repellent. Another approach to Jefferson Park across Park Ridge with even more incredible views is documented <a href=\"?track=T0120\">here</a>.",

After visiting the castle, the trail leads back down to the valley and the Panthier lake, a historic reservoir built in 1834 that it is used to feed the Bourgogne canal.
