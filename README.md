This is the Github web site where I host my personal blog, tests and experiments. Besides my blog, here are some other things ...

* [RikiTraki alpha](http://jimmyangel.github.io/rikitraki/) - My original personal hiking log. Alpha version of [RikiTraki](https://www.rikitraki.com).

* [A hike in Abel Tasman NP, NZ](http://jimmyangel.github.io/Maps/MapGeo/)- I developed this application for my final assignment deliverable ("Storytelling with maps") for the [Maps and the Geospatial Revolution](https://class.coursera.org/maps-003) MOOC course by Dr. Anthony C. Robinson, that I took between March and April of 2015. This was the starting point for [RikiTraki](https://www.rikitraki.com).
