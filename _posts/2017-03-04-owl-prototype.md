title: Owl Prototype

### So what is [this](http://blog.rikitraki.com/owl/)?

It is a small prototype for visualizing one of the old growth forest data sets published by the [Oregon Wild site](http://www.oregonwild.org/oregon_forests/map-gallery-1/interactive-old-growth-maps) using the web-based [Cesium.js](https://cesiumjs.org/) virtual globe and map engine. The prototype shows old growth areas in the Mount Hood National Forest in Oregon.

This is just the beginning of a project I will be developing incrementally. I will be enhancing this tool to incorporate additional data sets related to Oregon Wilderness areas and turning it into an interactive web application that will enable users select and combine multiple information layers and run time-based animations to show interesting changes over time and geography.

I am really excited about this project. Stay tuned!
