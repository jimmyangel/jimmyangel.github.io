This is just a brief post summarizing a few improvements I implemented recently on the 3D visualization part.

* Parity with the 2D visualization

	* Added track information box
	* Added displaying geopositioned thumbnails
	* Added layer control

* Seamless (i.e., no page reloads) track-to-track, track-to-globe, and globe-to-track navigation

* Browser Back and Forward without reload

Next post, a summary of my [FOSS4G-NA](https://2016.foss4g-na.org/) experience.
