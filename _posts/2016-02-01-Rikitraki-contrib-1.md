title: Adding content to RikiTraki (Part 1)

---
### Ready to save content to RikiTraki to share with your friends?

In [previous posts]({{site.baseurl}}/Rikitraki-intro-1) I described how to find and view tracks stored in the [RikiTraki](https://www.rikitraki.com) database. Now, I will walk through how to post your own tracks to visualize and share with others.

### First, register

The first step before you can post tracks, is to register with the site. This will enable you to add, edit and remove content, and you will be able to filter to see only the tracks that you uploaded, if you so desire.

Find and click on the user icon on the top right part of the screen ![RikiTraki]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/2016-02-01/rikitraki_contrib_1.png)

The login/register dialog will come up (assuming, of course, that you are not logged in already):

To register, click on the Register tab to access the registration form:

### But wait, what is an "invitation code"?

In the current beta version of RikiTraki, you will need to request an invitation code in order to register. This will go away soon. So, if you see that field in the form, go ahead and click on the "No invitation code?" link, enter your email address and click on the "Request invitation"button.

You will receive an invitation code via email. Be aware that during this beta phase, it could take a day or two, because I am personally reviewing each request. With your invitation code, come back to this dialog and complete the registration by filling out the form. Keep in mind that the email you enter in the registration form must match the one you used to request your invitation code.

### Ready to add content!

After you are registered, you will be automatically logged in and you will notice that by the appearance of the "Upload track" icon on the top left part of the screen (the little cloud with an up arrow in it). I will explain how that works in my next post.

Also, when you are logged in, by clicking on the user icon, you will see a dialog that allows you to log out or to update your password and/or your email address.

After registration, you are ready to add content!
